## Oculus VR recently purchased by Facebook for $2 billion

I was privaledged to have had the opportunity to try out the new [Oculus Rift](http://www.oculusvr.com/) devkit.

It was surprising just how much you actually feel like you're in this virtual space, as you pan around the graphics match exactually what you'd see in the virtual space.  Er.. you really have to try it to see what I mean.

Lots of fun, I haven't tried anything like that before.  I kept trying to touch things that were in front of me.  It was weird not to see your own hands though.  As I understand someone is working on gloves to interface with it.

### Blockabout

Blockabout was a surprisingly fun game that I got to try out with the goggles on.  To my delight I even got to experience getting eaten alive by pirahnas, nasty little fish!  ><}}}•<

The physics in this game is playful yet realistic at the same time.  This game is expected to be released in the coming weeks.  You will be able to download for free.

### the Star Trek holodeck

If you're on the virtual Star Trek enterprise go to the [holodeck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodeck) to experience virtual reality within a virtual reality game.  

#### warning: may experience dizziness.
