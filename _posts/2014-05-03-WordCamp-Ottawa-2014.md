## WordCamp Ottawa started off with a ZURB

Speaker Brendan Sera-Shriar of [theBrendans](http://www.thebrendans.com/) was pretty funny and very relaxed.  His talk aimed to convince us to use the Zurb Foundation framework which uses SASS, font icons, and zepto.js

It all sounded quite impressive and it seems well worth the effort to first design for the little mobile interface and then scale up to your 50" TVs.

This code began from a mobile app perspective but it also produces excellent responsive web pages you can put on your WordPress site.  I'll have to give it a try.

### False floors and cake layers

New jargon to learn about.  Do you know where to find the hamburger icon?  Do you use it very often?

There were just so many wonderful presentations to see, 32 in all on Saturday, fortunately WordCamp continues again tomorrow at noon.

Looking forward to more great stuff.
