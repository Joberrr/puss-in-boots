## I design this site for my own selfish reasons

Whether it be writing code or writing a web program it has been suggested that it's useful to have an audience or user in mind.
 Right now that user is mostly me.  I know, this is a design faux-pas. [You are not your user](http://52weeksofux.com/post/385981879/you-are-not-your-user)

But seriously, this site is aimed at pleasing me mostly.  So there you have it.

### Goals

I'd love to manage to get simplenote.js running on this site.  That'd be cool.

I just have to find the right line in the "_config.yml" I think.  

> Did that work?
