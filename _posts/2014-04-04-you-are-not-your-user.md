## You are not your user

Whether it be writing code or writing a web program it has been suggested that it's useful to have an audience or user in mind.
 Right now that user is mostly me.  I know, this is a design faux-pas. [You are not your user](http://52weeksofux.com/post/385981879/you-are-not-your-user)

But seriously, this site is aimed at pleasing me mostly.  So there you have it.

### Goals

I'd love to manage to get simplenote.js running on this site.  That'd be cool.

I'd also like to get another comments engine running besides DISCUS.  This should be very easy for me to change.

I just have to find the right line in the "_config.yml" I think.
