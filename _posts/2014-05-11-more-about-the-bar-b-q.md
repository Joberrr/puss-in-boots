## As you may know, I was going to ditch my old bar-b-q.

The neighbour down the street rolled it away.  Hopefully it all works out for him.

Now I'm thinking I like living without a Bar B Q.  Just continue using the stove.

Those of you in favour of getting a new Bar B Q let me know why I should.

### China Super Smog

Here in Gatineau we have beautiful weather and blue skies.  We are so fortunate.  I cannot imagine living in cities with so much smog.

It's so thick you can barely see through it.  You know we're all connected on this spaceship earth.  Burning coal is unecessary when you could be burning Thorium.

Converting coal into a clean energy source is possible, but why when safe nuclear is possible and cheaper?
