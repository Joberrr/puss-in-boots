## I'm going to ditch my old bar-b-q.

It still works, but it's getting pretty rusted inside.

It's hard to judge these things; probably when there are flames shooting out the bottom it's time to stop using your old bar-b-q.

I'm going to push it out front and put a 'free' sign on it.  Somebody will no doubt pick it up.

### Peak metal

We're going to be digging up less and less metal because there's less of it to dig up.  Not sure how recycling factors in.  

Makes me wonder if I should recycle my bar-b-q, lots of shiny metal still left in her.
