## Extreme lock-down mode!

### Computer says NO.

Forget trying to run Jekyll on your government issued pc, no, no, no, this machine has been locked down and preventive measures are now taken for such nonsense. Jekyll, spuhfah! not here.  It's for my own safety no doubt.  So for now, I can only get this running from my offsite mac.

You can give it a try yourself if you don't want to take my word for it (typically a wise choice not to).  Perhaps you'll be able to install ruby, and even python, but run Jekyll and this will cause you grief.  I tell you, NOT, I do tell thee.

### I'm not complaining, God no

Well, yes probably, there's just so much you can't do from within the firewall, so don't even try it buster. :-(

Which also reminds me that everything that is written here will go down on my permanent record or until I delete it.  Of course, anyone at anytime can clone/copy/fork or so otherwise copy this site in its entirety with a click of a button.  Uh but isn't that the norm now?  Copy/Paste. Copy/Paste.  Feel the power!  Savour it.
